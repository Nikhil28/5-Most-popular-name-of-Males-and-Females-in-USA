I love <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460681/" target="_blank">Supernatural Series</a> so, took some names for example from there. On this journey you will find Sam, Dean, Castiel, Jack, and Bobby in male charecters and in females charecters you will meet Billie, Rowena, Naomi, Ruby, and Amara.

One of the most surptising fact is name Mary (Mother of Sam and Dean in Supernatural Series) is the most popular name among all in the data set.
